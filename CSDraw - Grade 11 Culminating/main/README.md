CSDraw - Grade 11 Culminating Project
----
This program was developed as an extension of my paint application from Grade 10.

It is a simple drawing game that uses Google Vision API to score user drawn images. The program checks if the label that the API returns matches the label of the game objective. The 'score' that the API returns is then added to the user's score.

In order for this program to work, there **must be** a text file called "_API_KEY.txt_" in the same directory as the Processing files. This text file must contain a working Google Vision API key.
